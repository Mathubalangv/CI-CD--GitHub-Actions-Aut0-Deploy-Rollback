#Project Name: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for Automated Deployment and Rollback

#Overview

This project showcases the creation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates the process of building, deploying, and rolling back a React application on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). The application is containerized using Docker, stored in AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and managed via an ECS Cluster.

#Features

Automated Deployment: Streamlined process to automatically deploy updates to AWS ECS.

Rollback Support: Automated rollback in case of deployment failure.

Scalable Infrastructure: Utilizes AWS ECS for scalable and resilient application hosting.

Docker Containerization: Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

#Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and deploy your React application:

Setup Your React Application:

    npx create-react-app myapp

Create a Dockerfile:

  Navigate to the root of your myapp directory and create a Dockerfile.

Create nginx Configuration:

  Create an nginx.conf file in the root directory of myapp.

Elastic Container Registry (ECR):

  Create a private repository in AWS ECR.

Create an ECS Cluster:

  Set up a new ECS Cluster in AWS.

Define an ECS Task:

  Create an ECS task definition for the ECS Cluster.

Create an ECS Service:

  Set up an ECS service for the ECS Cluster.

Install Docker:

  Ensure Docker is installed on your local machine.

Add Workflow Configuration:

  Create a deploy.yml file inside the .github/workflows/ directory.

Set AWS Credentials:

  Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in the GitHub Repository settings under "Actions" secrets.

Commit and Push Changes:

  Push your changes to the GitHub repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

Monitor the Workflow:

  Watch the deployment process in the "Actions" tab.

Access the Running Application:

  Visit the ECS public IP to see the deployed React app.

#Conclusion

  This project provides a robust, automated solution for deploying React applications using AWS services and GitHub Actions. It simplifies the deployment process while ensuring reliability and scalability through the use of Docker and ECS.
